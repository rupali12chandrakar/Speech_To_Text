# Speech_To_Text
This project demonstrates how to convert human speech into text using **Google's Speech Recognition API** in Python. It runs entirely in **Google Colab** ‚Äî no setup required!

## üìå Objective

The goal is to showcase a simple and efficient way to convert voice/audio files to text using AI. This project illustrates the potential of speech recognition in real-world applications such as virtual assistants and transcription systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Google Colab**
- **SpeechRecognition** (for transcription)
- **Pydub** (for audio conversion)
- **Google Speech Recognition API**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-to-text-ai.git
cd voice-to-text-ai
‚úÖ Open in Google Colab
Click the button below to open the notebook directly in Colab:


‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
python
Copy
Edit
!pip install SpeechRecognition pydub --quiet
Step 2: Upload an Audio File
python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
Upload a short .wav or .mp3 file (e.g., "Hello, my name is Rupali"). If it's an .mp3, the script will convert it to .wav.

Step 3: Convert & Recognize Speech
python
Copy
Edit
import speech_recognition as sr
from pydub import AudioSegment

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
audio_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]

if not audio_path.endswith(".wav"):
    sound = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)
    audio_path = audio_path.split('.')[0] + ".wav"
    sound.export(audio_path, format="wav")

with sr.AudioFile(audio_path) as source:
    audio = recognizer.record(source)
    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print("Recognized Text:", text)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand audio.")
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("API unavailable or limit reached.")
